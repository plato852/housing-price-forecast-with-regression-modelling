Forecasting housing prices in the UK South Eastern Area using the data scraped from Savills

### 🖼️ A small background of this project
My family recently moved to the UK, and we're currently looking at houses in the Southeast. It's been a bit of a struggle, like it is for everyone when making a big purchase. So I've decided to do some extra research on the area we're interested in. I want to gather more information and hopefully make a well-informed final decision.
