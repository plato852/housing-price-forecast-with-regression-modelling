My family recently moved to the UK, and we're currently looking at houses in the Southeast. It's been a bit of a struggle, like it is for 

everyone when making a big purchase. So I've decided to do some extra research on the area we're interested in. By collecting additional 

information and gaining a broader perspective, I aim for us to reach a data-driven conclusion.
