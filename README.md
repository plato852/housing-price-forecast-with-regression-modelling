# 🏘 Housing prices forecast -- UK 🇬🇧 (southeast)
```
Forecasting housing prices in the UK South Eastern Area using the data scraped from Savills
```
## 🖼️ A small background of this project
My family recently moved to the UK, and we're currently looking at houses in the Southeast. It's been a bit of a struggle, like it is for 

everyone when making a big purchase. So, I've decided to do some extra research on the area we're interested in. By collecting additional 

information and gaining a broader perspective, I aim for us to reach a data-driven conclusion.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Where do I get these data from & How do I deal with them
Scraping Housing Data: [webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io/): This enabled me to conveniently gather different pieces of information from each listing using a point-and-click interface. The 113 properties' data was scraped from Savills, an informative real estate website.
